## Welcome!

## Downloading R and R Studio

Before the first session, it would be INCREDIBLY helpful for you to have R and R Studio installed on the machine you're working with. You can follow the instructions below. If you're working on a McDaniel PC or Mac, you'll need to get in touch with IT in order to get these installed. PLEASE do this ahead of time.

1.  Navigate to [bit.ly/mcdbs_rstudio](bit.ly/mcdbs_rstudio).
2.   First, download R onto your computer. The latest release is called “2023-06-16, Beagle Scouts” which is the  4.3.1 version of R. You should be able to download it by following the buttons. If you’re stuck, Google around or ask me!
3.  Once you have R downloaded, download R studio. You should be roughly downloading version 2023.06.2+561.
4.  Once you have those two downloaded, open R studio and make sure you know how to find it on your computer.
